###Pygame work in progress

Work in progress of a simple asteroid dodging sort of game. The future use of this project
will be to train a neural network to play the game at or better at a level of a human player.
More to come.

Old project of mine that is being refactored as the old one was a bit ugly. 
May use a Resnet instead of the genetic neural network but hey, we'll see.
